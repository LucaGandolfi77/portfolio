Hardly are those words out\nWhen a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi\nTroubles my sight; somewhere in sands of the desert\nA shape with lion body and the head of a man,\nA gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,\nIs moving its slow thighs, while all about it\nReel shadows of the indignant desert birds.\n\nThe darkness drops again; but now I know\nThat twenty centuries of stony sleep\nWere vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,\nAnd what rough beast, its hour come round at last,\nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"
